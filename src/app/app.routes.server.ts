/**
 * ðŸ’¡ Important notes:
 * Dynamic routes with params (:id) cannot be prerendered unless you explicitly define getPrerenderParams.
 * Angularâ€™s prerender extractor expects at least one static prerendered route ('' or 'products/home').
 * This combination (3 prerendered + 2 server routes) works in Angular 19.1 â€“ 19.2 builds.
