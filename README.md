# MyAngularProject

```
npm run build
npm run serve:ssr:angularCrud
```

    -   app.config.server.ts: Used for server application configuration.

    -   src/app/app.server.module.ts: Includes the server-side application module for Angular Universal SSR.
    -   src/server.ts: This file is used by the Express server to render the Angular application on the server-side.
